          Most photographers love to shoot the unusual, and you don’t get much
          more unusual than These Unprecedented Times. Right now everything
          counts as out of the ordinary. There are a number of remarkable things
          about these lockdown days that are worth photographing now so we can
          remember them when it is all over.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pretend everything is new and that you haven’t seen it before, and
          then you will be free to notice the leading lines, the places where
          one edge meets another in delightful geometric harmony, and how the
          ordinary things in the kitchen are transformed when the light is on or
          off.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trick here is to look slowly, and then look again. Take the time
          to look in detail and to look at the same thing from different angles,
          with different light, long lenses and wide lenses. Then move to the
          left a bit. You may never feel the need to leave the house again.
