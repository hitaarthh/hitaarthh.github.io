          In the summer of 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to intern at SLB (PuTC) as a Software Engineering Intern. It was a journey filled not only with hands-on technical growth but also with unforgettable memories of Pune, a city buzzing with energy and vibrance. The experience pushed me out of my comfort zone and helped me refine my skills, while also immersing me in a culture of collaboration and innovation.

          Working at SLB, I gained exposure to real-world software engineering practices, from developing efficient code to understanding the intricacies of system design. Under the mentorship of my manager and guidance from an amazing team, I navigated through challenges that taught me the importance of adaptability, teamwork, and proactive problem-solving. Each task, project, and discussion contributed to my growth, making me more confident in my abilities as an aspiring software engineer.

          But it wasn’t just about the work. Pune, with its bustling streets, historic landmarks, and vibrant social scene, added a unique charm to this journey. Weekends were spent exploring the city’s iconic spots, trying local cuisine, and soaking in the lively atmosphere that Pune is known for. It was a perfect balance—immersing myself in challenging projects during the week and experiencing the cultural richness of Pune on my days off.

           I journeyed to Malegaon, a serene village in Maharashtra, as part of the Live In Labs Programme. Alongside my team, Community Catalyst, we ventured into villages like Ambewadi and Bhandravali, immersing ourselves in the lives, traditions, and stories of the local communities. Living among the villagers, we became part of their world, experiencing the beauty of rural life firsthand.

          Our purpose was to understand and address the socio-economic challenges facing these communities through human-centered design. While we worked on identifying and creating sustainable solutions, the true essence of our journey lay in the cultural exchange that unfolded each day.

          Our days were filled with rich interactions, whether through community sessions, shared meals, or spontaneous conversations with locals. Their resilience, kindness, and dedication to their customs left an indelible mark on our hearts. This journey not only opened our eyes to India’s rural strength but also reinforced why it is celebrated as "Incredible India"—a land of boundless spirit, culture, and unity.

          The true beauty of this place reveals itself slowly, encouraging one to pause and take in each moment with a fresh perspective. It teaches us to look closer, to appreciate every angle, every shift in light, and to embrace the unexpected details that bring life into focus. Here, I learned that sometimes, the most profound discoveries are not in distant places but in simply shifting our view—finding wonder in what’s right in front of us.
